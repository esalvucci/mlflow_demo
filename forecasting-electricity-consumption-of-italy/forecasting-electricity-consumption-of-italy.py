# MLFlow Demo - Forecasting hourly electricity consumption of Italy
# [From Kaggle - "Forecasting electricity consumption of Germany" Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/francoisraucent/forecasting-electricity-consumption-of-germany)
# 
# Electricity grid and market have become increasingly challenging to operate and maintain in the recent years. In particular, one of the main responsibilities of transmission system operators and aggregators consists in maintaining balance between production and consumption. With the development and spread of renewable energy sources, production has become more intermittent which requires even more effort to maintain the balance.
# 
# One of the underlying task of maintaining grid balance, it to forecast the consumption. In this analysis, we train and test a few models to forecast total german load, on an hourly basis, with a lead time of 24 hours.
# 
# The data was retrieved from [ENTSO-E Transparency Platform](https://transparency.entsoe.eu/), which provides access to electricity generation, transportation, and consumption data for the pan-European market.
# 
# This notebook follows a structure similar to [this nice tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/robikscube/tutorial-time-series-forecasting-with-xgboost) from [Rob Mulla](https://www.kaggle.com/robikscube). The main adaptations are the following :
# * it applies to German load instead of PJM data covering US east region,
# * it includes additional features such as holidays and lag features,
# * a linear model, and a random forest are used as baselines in addition to the XGB model,
# * the final XGB model is finetuned with some grid search CV.

# * time features: month, weekday and hour
# * national holiday features, as a boolean time series
# * lag features: load data with a lag values ranging from 24 to 48 hours

# The lag features introduce a few missing values which we will move out of the analysis. The features of our training set are then the following :
